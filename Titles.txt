; Original file name Titles.txt must not be altered!

; Some preferred Titles / Authors
; This list may be extended if you have other preferences

; Entries will be used as a pattern using the Like-operator (see http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/swf8kaxw.aspx)
; and recording will be turned on when the transmitted title matches one of the patterns and off if it does not.
; The entries are not case-sensitive. Thanks to Michael Döring for this idea.

; If this file does not exist or is empty then recording will be turned on anyway.
