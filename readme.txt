Tune to internet radio stations and record music on your hard disk while playing at the same time. 

This app was almost completely rewritten from code by Coder Ghost (CodeId=64608) and now includes a wm-player so you can listen to the broadcasts received. Also added was the option to save the music into different files named after the title of the song and into a different folder under the application folder. A list of station names and URLs is included. Goto Shoutcast.com for more playlists and extract URLs and station names using NetStations.txt contents as an example how to do that. Download is 39 kB.

You can now cheat it into playing a song which exists on your hard disk:

1 - Go into single file mode
2 - Select the song using the little browse-button
3 - Click Restart
